# Customer Feedback Analysis

## Overview

This project is dedicated to analyzing customer complaints data sourced from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Utilizing the Consumer Complaint Database, we aim to uncover significant patterns and insights that can drive improvements in customer service and product offerings. The analysis leverages big data technologies, particularly **Hadoop** and **Pig scripts**, to efficiently process and analyze large volumes of data.

## Key Findings

- **Timeliness of Responses:**  
  This analysis highlights a strong correlation between the timeliness of responses from companies and overall customer satisfaction. Quicker responses often result in fewer escalated complaints, suggesting that improving response times could enhance customer experiences.

- **Company Performance Insights:**  
  The data reveals that specific companies receive a disproportionately high number of complaints. These findings indicate areas where these companies can enhance customer service, reduce complaint volumes, and ultimately improve their public perception.
