# Customer Feedback Analysis

## Overview

This project is dedicated to analyzing customer complaints data sourced from the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Utilizing the Consumer Complaint Database, we aim to uncover significant patterns and insights that can drive improvements in customer service and product offerings. The analysis leverages big data technologies, particularly **Hadoop** and **Pig scripts**, to efficiently process and analyze large volumes of data.

## Key Findings

- **Timeliness of Responses:**  
  Our analysis highlights a strong correlation between the timeliness of responses from companies and overall customer satisfaction. Quicker responses often result in fewer escalated complaints, suggesting that improving response times could enhance customer experiences.

- **Company Performance Insights:**  
  The data reveals that specific companies receive a disproportionately high number of complaints. These findings indicate areas where these companies can enhance customer service, reduce complaint volumes, and ultimately improve their public perception.

- **Product-Specific Trends:**  
  Certain products emerge as frequent subjects of complaints, indicating that consumers encounter consistent issues. These insights can guide companies in refining product features, improving quality control, and providing better consumer education to mitigate misunderstandings.

- **Geographical Patterns:**  
  Our investigation uncovers geographical trends in complaint data, suggesting that some regions face unique challenges. Understanding these regional differences is crucial for tailoring customer support strategies and effectively addressing localized issues.

## Methodology

The project utilizes **Hadoop** for distributed data processing, ensuring scalability and efficiency. **Pig scripts** are employed to perform data transformation and analysis tasks, allowing for complex queries and aggregations on large datasets. This approach facilitates deep insights while leveraging the power of big data technologies.

## Technologies Used

- **Big Data Framework:** Cloudera Hortonworks (HDP)
- **Data Processing:** Hadoop, Pig Scripts

## Conclusion

This project underscores the importance of customer feedback in shaping effective business strategies. By leveraging big data technologies, we can derive actionable insights that empower companies to enhance their customer service and product offerings.
